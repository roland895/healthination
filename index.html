					I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye <br />
					Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye<br />
					I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye<br />
					The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye<br />
					I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye<br />
					I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye<br />
					See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes<br />
					And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes<br />
					I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye<br />
					I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye<br />
					What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?<br />
					Called \"I Miss The Old Kanye,\" man that'd be so Kanye<br />
					That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye<br />
					And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye
